## Automatic Updates Feature Setup

We've added an exciting new feature to our game: Automatic Updates. Here's how we did it:

### 1. Setting Up a New Tool

We downloaded and installed a new tool to our gaming console, the Firebase CLI. This tool will help manage automatic updates for our game.

### 2. Logging into the Account

We logged into our game developer account using Firebase Login to access our game's cloud settings.

### 3. Starting the New Feature

We decided to add a new feature to our game: automatic updates. We started setting up this feature by running `firebase init`.

### 4. Choosing Settings

We were asked a series of questions to customize the new feature. These included which parts of the game should receive automatic updates and where the updates should come from. We selected our game's main files (public directory), set it up as a single-page game (all URLs point to index.html), and decided to link it with our game's cloud account on GitHub for automatic updates.

### 5. Linking with the Cloud

We connected our game to our GitHub account, setting up actions (workflows) that will automatically update our game (deploy our site to Firebase Hosting) when we or our teammates make changes (when pull requests are merged).

### 6. Finalizing the Feature

We finished setting up the new feature! Firebase created a set of instructions (workflow files and configuration files) that tell our game how to update automatically. It also gave us a key (service account JSON) that lets our game access our Firebase account securely.

Now, we're about to save this new feature (commit our changes) and upload it to the game's cloud server (push to GitHub) so that it's officially part of our game. This will enable the automatic updates feature, keeping our game always updated with the latest changes that we make.
