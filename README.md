# App Component

Description

The App component is a functional React component that serves as the main entry point for the application. It renders a simple UI consisting of a header displaying “Hello StackBlitz!” and a paragraph with the text “Start editing to see some magic happen :)”.

Props

This component does not accept any props.

Usage

To use the App component, simply import it into your React application and include it in your component tree. Below is a basic example of how to integrate the App component:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App'; // Adjust the import path according to your file structure

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

Styling

The component uses an external CSS file for styling. Make sure the style.css file is located in the same directory as the App component and includes any necessary CSS rules. The provided example does not specify any particular styles, so you’ll need to customize the style.css file as needed.

Additional Notes

	•	This component is created using functional component syntax introduced in React 16.8, which allows for a simpler and more concise way to write components.
	•	The component does not manage any state or lifecycle methods, making it a presentational component.
	•	For larger applications, consider breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components.

This documentation provides a basic overview of the App component, how to use it, and where it fits within your application. If your component evolves to include props, state, or more complex functionality, you’ll want to update the documentation accordingly.

## Automatic Updates Feature Setup

We've added an exciting new feature to our game: Automatic Updates. Here's how we did it:

### 1. Setting Up a New Tool

We downloaded and installed a new tool to our gaming console, the Firebase CLI. This tool will help manage automatic updates for our game.

### 2. Logging into the Account

We logged into our game developer account using Firebase Login to access our game's cloud settings.

### 3. Starting the New Feature

We decided to add a new feature to our game: automatic updates. We started setting up this feature by running `firebase init`.

### 4. Choosing Settings

We were asked a series of questions to customize the new feature. These included which parts of the game should receive automatic updates and where the updates should come from. We selected our game's main files (public directory), set it up as a single-page game (all URLs point to index.html), and decided to link it with our game's cloud account on GitHub for automatic updates.

### 5. Linking with the Cloud

We connected our game to our GitHub account, setting up actions (workflows) that will automatically update our game (deploy our site to Firebase Hosting) when we or our teammates make changes (when pull requests are merged).

### 6. Finalizing the Feature

We finished setting up the new feature! Firebase created a set of instructions (workflow files and configuration files) that tell our game how to update automatically. It also gave us a key (service account JSON) that lets our game access our Firebase account securely.

Now, we're about to save this new feature (commit our changes) and upload it to the game's cloud server (push to GitHub) so that it's officially part of our game. This will enable the automatic updates feature, keeping our game always updated with the latest changes that we make.
